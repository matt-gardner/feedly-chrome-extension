# Feedly Chrome Extension

I wanted a simple app that would learn to automatically classify items in Feedly into "I want to
read this", and "I don't want to read this".  I looked into using the Feedly API, and it looked
too complicated, because I had to get a key from them in order to access the API.  They use some
javascript that makes scraping the site hard, so that doesn't work either.  So I figured a Chrome
extension should be able to run after the javascript loads the articles.  I had a hard time
getting the keypresses to work right with javascript, though, so this isn't functional yet.  Maybe
sometime I'll get back to trying to make this work.
